WEBSCRAPER WORKS

Program, when run, will first go to my twitter account and save the entire page's html to a variable. From there, it will create an object to store my handle and the account's password (found in quotation marks in bio) to th object's instance variables. After that, it will navigate to the login page of twitter, type out my username and password, and enter my account. It switches immediately to my account's profile page, clicks post, and writes out a silly post and posts it. The whole process takes on averages 8 seconds, with the longest run still taking less than 10, and the fastest being 6.3 seconds.
